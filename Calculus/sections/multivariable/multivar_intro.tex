\section{Multivariable Functions}

These functions are maps from higher Euclidean dimensions to the real numbers, i.e. \( \mathbb{R}^n \) to \( \mathbb{R} \).

We describe the domain of these functions as all allowable inputs for each variable, the codomain as simply \( \mathbb{R} \)
and the range as all values or outputs.

\begin{example}[]
    Compute and sketch the domain and range of \( f(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2-y^2}} \).

    We require \( x^2-y^2 > 0 \) to stay in the real numbers. Thus, \( x^2 > y^2 \).
    \[ x > \pm \, y \text{ if } x > 0 \]
    \[ -x > \pm \, y \text{ if } x < 0 \]

    % Domain: *insert sketch here*

    Range: Get all \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2}} = \frac{1}{|x|} \therefore (0,\infty) \)
\end{example}

\textit{More Examples:}
\begin{center}
    \( f(x,y,z) = \ln(16-4x^2-4y^2-z^2) \)
    \( \downarrow \)
    \( 16-4x^2-4y^2-z^2 > 0 \)
\end{center} 
Thus, the domain is a ellipsoid and the range is \( (-\infty,\ln16) \).

\section{Graphing Multivariable Functions}

For a multivariable function in the form of 
To graph multivariable functions, we need a way to convey the higher dimensions.

An easy way to do this is using a
