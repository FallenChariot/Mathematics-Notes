\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}
This document compiles all my notes on differential equations including any self-study.
Some sections require content from other math subjects to be completed understood (such as linear algebra or other analysis topics).
The corresponding topic and section will be referred to in-text.

If you need this for school and industry, I hope that you are able to do whatever you are trying to accomplish.
If you are here because this interests you, I hope you find this as entertaining as I did.
