I was originally going to spending the summer of 2024 typing up my old math notes.
Then I realized that I was going to need Real Analysis for Complex Analysis.
Makes sense based on the name.
I just assumed that I would be fine since Real Analysis wasn't a prerequisite for the course I was taking.
Whoops.
